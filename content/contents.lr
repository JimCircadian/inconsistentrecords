Thanks for visiting.

Inconsistent Records is the personal site for Jim Circadian...

You’ll find blog posts and resources relating to technology, music, science
(maybe) and eventually I’ll stick up some photos. Basically it’s a
landing site for anything relating to his weird and wonderful life.

I hope you find something you like!
