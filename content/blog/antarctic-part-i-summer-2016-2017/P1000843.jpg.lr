caption: The first sunrise towards winter. A real privilege to see it as most don't during a summer season, and the weather around you changes so much when the sun starts to disappear. Again with the SuperDARN array in the picture, showing an interesting curve, the result of the internal structure of the ice shelf resulting in dropped antennae: all part of the voyage of discovery about ice shelves!
